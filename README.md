A collection of simple games made in the p5.js library

This collection includes some of my favorite projects from when I was learning how to code. Here are the highlights:

- **🧱 Breakout**: My first p5.js project and game, where I learned how to work with objects, arrays, and collision detection
- **🏗️ Stack 3D**: My personal favorite of my old projects, where I learned how to develop 3D games and translate between coordinate systems
- **🟨 2048**: Recreated one of my favorite mobile games, where I implemented more complex algorithms with arrays
